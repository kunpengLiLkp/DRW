# DRW (directed random walk)

This is an implementation of the DRW algorithm from the paper Topologically Inferring Risk-Active Pathways toward Precise Cancer Classification by Directed Random Walk. The developers only implemented the part that computes pathway activity; if there are any issues, please feel free to leave a comment for discussion.
